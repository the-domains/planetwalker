# What is the Planet Walker about?

I love to explore this planet of ours.  

Every nook and cranny has something amazing to see, to learn, to be.

And one of the best ways to explore is to simply take. your. time.  Smell the proverbial roses and walk through the world like a mystic vagabond.  Infuse the essence of all you experience into each step you take.

And never take a single step for granted.  You never know when you'll be struck by gout.
